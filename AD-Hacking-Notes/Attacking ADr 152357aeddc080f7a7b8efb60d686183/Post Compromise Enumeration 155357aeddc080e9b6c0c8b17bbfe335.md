# Post Compromise Enumeration

- Enumerating the domains SAM databse via `ldapdomaindump`
    - ldapdomaindump needs a password and a username that can authenticate to the domain itself, that user mostly can enumerate a service, or the whole domain by default.

- As seenable, ldampdomaindump uses `LDAP` to access shares and enumerate Objects and Policies , including user Descriptions etc.

Enumeration with Bloodhound

</aside>

When using Bloodhound we need to use `neo4j`

[](https://neo4j.com/)

Its a database running on ur Machine as a `webservice`

- We need to setup Bloodhound itself which is the Graphical-UI hosted as a Webservice aswell:
- And then the injector which collects the data and parses it over to Bloodhound.
    - `The magic happens through the injector`
