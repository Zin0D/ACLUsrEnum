LSASSY Attacks

</aside>

When enumerating the Security Policies, we can use crackmapexec, to dump the LSASSY file, which contains the policies and also `Credentials.`

- `If an Active user is logged in we could dump those credentials`

In this case, we want to get either a Domain Admin account or the Local dc Admin account.

All Domain Admins are automatically part of the local Admins on the machine, the default Admin of the Dc is not automatically included in the Domain-Admins group.

WDigest

</aside>

When running Secretsdump, we can also check for `WDIGEST`.

- Force Wdigest (If login occours) So when someone logs in , we can capture the Plain-Text password.
