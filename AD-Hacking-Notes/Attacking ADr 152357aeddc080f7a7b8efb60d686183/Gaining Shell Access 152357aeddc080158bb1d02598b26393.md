# Gaining Shell Access

- Gaining Shells can be done through `Metasploit through PSexec`

    `METASPLOIT IS NOISY:`
    
    `psexec.py` is quiter, so this is a good tool to use, if wanting to get a shell (Still kinda noisy)
    
    - Building your own Tool is important.
    - Like metasploit, uses Hashes or the Password to connect to a machine.

Domain Compromise, does need a Shell, most of the time, it can be compromised without a Shell.

- `Using the machine can still be used for lateral movement etc.`
    - when gathering shells, keep in mind to also use 32bit payloads, due to 64bit CPU Architecture, we tend to overlook the 32bit running machines.

- Sweep Attacks and Background the Sessions in MetaSploit is a good attack strategy `(Noisy tho)`

Hashes are devided into parts, `Upper Part is: LM, Bottom is NT` I have to ch

# PassBack-Attacks

Il put this here, since this is to small to have an own page.
If there is anything configured to access LDAP (Printer Credentials via LDAP Bind) or a WebService, or anything else)

If we cannot see the input-Password due to visibility proteciton, we may `forward the request to ourselfs.` We can do this by simply sending
