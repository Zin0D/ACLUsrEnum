# Active Directory 
This repository focuses on hacking and compromising the `Active-Directory` security within an internal network.

## Recon & Exploitation.
- The scripts in this repository are designed to enumerate and exploit `Active-Directory`.
- This repository is not complete and will therefore be updated whenever i can.

## Scripts Overview
- This repository contains a set of PowerShell scripts designed for **enumerating Active Directory (AD) objects**, focusing on user, group, and access control list (ACL) enumeration.
- These scripts are ideal for security auditing and penetration testing, offering multiple ways to gather crucial information from your AD environment.

### PowerShell Version 2  
- All scripts `leverage **PowerShell version 2** to **evade logging**` (as logging was introduced in PowerShell v3). This helps `prevent logs from being generated during script execution`, offering a stealthier approach for auditing. Additionally, the scripts ensure that **PowerShell history is deleted** after usage for further discretion.

## Ethical Usage
- These scripts should only be used for `ethical purposes`, such as security auditing, penetration testing, and within environments where you have explicit authorization.**`Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical`.**
